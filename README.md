#Philosophy Prompter
###Codecademy | Portfolio Project: Mixed Messages
##Description
Introducing "Philosophy Prompter" - an application designed to randomly generate philosophical questions, conditions and ways to communicate your responses. With Philosophy Prompter, you can challenge yourself to explore deep philosophical concepts and think critically about the world around you. The application generates questions that will make you ponder the meaning of life, ethics, and morality, and provides unique conditions that will require you to approach the question from a specific perspective.
##Project Requirements
Build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
